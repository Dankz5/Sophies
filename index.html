            <!-- <p>It all started on June 18th  1988 in Rochester, Minnesota, when Bruce and Gayle were wed.  Two years later they had their first son Benjamin. Their daughter Jennifer was born next, and two years later the Kall family was complete with their son Jack. 
                Ever since Jennifer can remember her mother had called her Sophie. Nobody knows why. There honestly isn’t any reasonable explanation behind it, but it fit, so it stuck.  Even some of Jennifer’s close friends call her Sophie.
                Bruce and Gayle raised all three children in a small neighborhood in Rochester, Minnesota. All three of the children were athletic, but Jennifer always had more of a love for art than her brothers, she got this from her mother, although her dad had an artistic side. 
                Growing up ‘Sophie’ had an “art cupboard” in the family’s kitchen.  This cupboard consisted of; gel pens, construction paper, glitter glue, paint, crayons, pipe cleaners, rulers, scissors, colored pencils, glue, and sparkles, lots of sparkles, along with anything else a little girl could dream of.  When Jennifer would get put in a time out, she didn’t just get sent to her room, her art supplies would be taken away. This was hard on her mother but it was the only punishment that ever worked for her ‘Sophie.’
                When Jennifer was a senior in high school she decided that she wanted to attend college to study graphic design. She chose to get her degree from The University of Minnesota Duluth. She chose Duluth because it is a naturally beautiful artsy city.  
                Once all three of the Kall children were out of the house Gayle began to make jewelry. She made beautiful earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. At first she began doing this as a hobby, but then some of her coworkers and friends began to buy her jewelry.  Gayle put some thought into it and decided it was time to make her hobby into a career.
                Gayle consulted with her daughter, the graphic designer and the two of them decided to open a boutique: Sophie’s. Gayle creates the jewelry, while Jennifer manages the website and other marketing factors for the company. The two work together to curate the clothing, shoes, and other fun gifts. 
                Sophie’s is a family owned boutique that is run off of love and creativity. We hope to help inspire other creative souls much like ourselves with our fun clothing and accessories! </p>
